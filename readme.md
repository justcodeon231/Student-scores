# 🎓 Student Score Manager - Assignment Project

Welcome to the **Student Score Manager**! 📝 This little project was originally created for an assignment 📚, but I thought I'd share it here on GitHub for fun. If you're into coding exercises, or just want a quick program to manage student scores, you’re in the right place! 🚀

## Project Overview 📋

This program allows users to:
- Input scores for 5 students 💯
- Calculate the **average score** 🧮
- Identify the **highest** and **lowest scores** 🏆📉
- Display all scores in the order they were entered 🗂️

The project is implemented in **two languages** for versatility: C++ and Python. Choose whichever flavor you prefer! 🍫🐍

## Features 🛠️

- **Easy Input**: Simply enter each student’s score, and the program does the rest!
- **Automatic Calculations**: Average, highest, and lowest scores are calculated instantly! ⚡
- **Orderly Display**: See all scores in the order they were entered, with clear labels for each student.
- **Cross-Language Support**: C++ for the hardcore fans, Python for the ease lovers! 💻🐍

## Specifications 📐

- **Input**: The program accepts 5 integer scores (one for each student).
- **Output**:
  - All scores in entry order
  - The **average score**, rounded to two decimal places (e.g., `65.00`)
  - The **highest** and **lowest** scores in the group
- **Languages**: C++ and Python
- **Requirements**:
  - **C++**: Any compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
  - **Python**: Python 3.6+

## How to Run 🏃

### C++ Version

1. **Compile** the program:
   ```bash
   g++ student_scores.cpp -o student_scores
   ```
2. **Run** the compiled file:
   ```bash
   ./student_scores
   ```

### Python Version

1. Just **run** the Python script directly:
   ```bash
   python3 student_scores.py
   ```

## Sample Output 📊

Here’s what the output looks like when you run the program:

```
Enter the scores for 5 students:
Enter score for student 1: 89
Enter score for student 2: 90
Enter score for student 3: 67
Enter score for student 4: 23
Enter score for student 5: 56

Scores entered:
Student 1: 89
Student 2: 90
Student 3: 67
Student 4: 23
Student 5: 56

Average score: 65.00
Highest score: 90
Lowest score: 23
```

## Notes 📝

> **This project was created for a programming assignment**—so don't be surprised by the simplicity! It's mainly a practice project for handling basic input/output, arrays, and loops. But hey, who doesn't love a classic coding exercise? 😄
